  READING SIMPLE SWITCHES RELIABLY, WITH OR WITHOUT A SWITCH PULL DOWN RESISTOR
  '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
  In this example sketch we look at configuring a simple button switch such that when pressed
  it will toggle a LED on and off.  The sketch automatically allows for one of two switch
  circuits to be configured, either with a pull down switch resistor or without.  This is configured
  and controlled with a simple macro parameter - see points of note below.

  Additionally, this sketch offers two methods to read a simple button switch, each offered as a
  specific function.  Only one function method should be configured (..._method_1/..._method_2),
  the choice left to preference of the user. The differences between each method is highlighted and
  explained below:
    Method 1 -  Function 'bool read_switch_method_1()' - this version of switch reading examines the switch
                input once each time the function is called.
                This allows the code section from which it is called to continue without waiting
                for the switch press cycle to complete once switching is initiated.
                Only drawback, of course, is that the design of the calling code must ensure that the
                switch is regularly tested to catch a change in switch status.

    Method 2 -  Function 'bool read_switch_method_2()' - this version of switch reading will wait for a
                switch cycle to complete, once it is initiated, before control is returned to the calling code.
                Once the switch is pressed, the code will fully consume the debounce period AFTER switch
                release until control is returned back to the calling code.
                That is, the calling code will be held up once the switch is pressed and until
                the debounce period has elapsed.

  Points of note:
    1.  The digital pin chosen as the input is initialised according to the 'circuit_type' macro
        parameter, either INPUT_PULLUP or INPUT using a call to pinMode(button_switch,circuit_type)
        in the setup() function.
        As the conditions for detecting switch on/off are different for each 'circuit_type' (they are
        reversed) two variables are used ('switch_low' and 'switch_high') to provide a reference
        indicating low and high (on/off) conditions.  However, this is transparent to the functioning
        of the code.  The only requirement is to define the 'circuit_type', everything else is
        automatically taken care of.

    2.  The design for each reading method incorporates code to debounce spurious inputs when the switch
        is pressed which, if not accounted for, would produce unexpected/spurious results.

    3.  The wiring designs for each type of switch circuit are:

        With switch pull down resistor configured and 'circuit_type' of INPUT

              10K ohm     button      (onboard)
              resistor    switch         LED

         |              |         |       |
         0v         pin = 2      +5v    pin =
                                    LED_BUILTIN
         ___________________________________
         |            ARDUINO              |

        With NO switch pull down resistor configured and 'circuit_type' of INPUT_PULLUP

             button     (onboard)
             switch        LED
            ___ \___        O
           |        |       |
         pin 2     0v     pin =
                       LED_BUILTIN

    5.  The on board LED (MEGA 2560) is utilised for testing to keep circuit design to a minimum.
        If not using the onboard LED then configure one in the traditional way using a 230ohm resistor (for
        a red LED) and a red LED on a breadboard, or otherwise.
